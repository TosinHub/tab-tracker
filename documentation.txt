TAB TRACKER VEUJS/EXPRESS JS APPLICATION
Install the latest version of NODE.
Create a github repo for the project and clone into your local workspaces
Install VueJs globally from your command line $npm install -g vue-cli
Next initiate a vueJs template into a client folder where the all VueJs code would reside $vue init webpack(//template name) client (//project-name)
Using/Running npm install from the command line, you would install all dependencies in the package.json file
In case it gives npm ERR! code EINTEGRITY error, follow the following steps
 npm cache clean --force
 npm i -g npm
 npm install

After successful installation, run npm run dev
Then run localhost:8080 from your browser, you should see welcome to VueJS
Next is to make a server folder in your tab-tracker folder...mkdir server from command prompt
(This is to ut the client side and server side codes to be in different folders)

cd into the server folder and $ npm init -f
That would create the package.json file
Then $ npm install --save nodemon eslint
(nodemon helps keep restarting the server when you make any change to your code)
If you have issues like permission denied error use $ npm config set unsafe-perm true

After installing nodemon and eslint, update the scripts secion of the package.json file with 

   "start": "nodemon src/app.js --exec  \"npm run lint && node\"",
    "lint": "eslint src/**/*.js",


Create a new folder in your server folder and name it src, then create a file called app.js inside the src folder
 
 

Then initiate eslint $ node ./node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js --init
